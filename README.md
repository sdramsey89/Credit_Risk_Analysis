# Credit Risk Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to apply machine learning to solve the real-world challenge of analyzing credit card risk. In order to do this, I built and evaluated several machine learning models to see which would best predict credit risk. Machine learning algorithms like the ones used here could be used to help predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.
